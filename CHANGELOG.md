  - Omit an HTML file (e.g. [ZIM Tree Puzzle](https://gist.github.com/lostintangent/5916cb2b62bbfcdcda0ac108a479bfd2))
  - Reference external stylesheets (e.g. [Hotel Reservation Design](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/pen/eYmWRdm))

## v0.0.28 (12/24/2019)

- Added support for playgrounds to include relative URLs in their `index.html` file
- Improved the CodePen interop with playgrounds by adding support for pens that omit a script file, which is neccessary for CodePen interop (e.g. [Loading Liquid Animation](https://codepen.io/prathameshkoshti/pen/MWYmzeM)

- Added support for `.jsx` and `.tsx` files within a playground. If you rename your `script.js` file to one of these extensions, then you can include JSX in the file and it will be automatically compiled. Additionally, the `GistPad > Playground: Script Language` setting now supports two new values: `javascriptreact` and `typescriptreact`. Finally, in order to simplify React-based playgrounds, the `react` and `react-dom` libraries will be automatically injected into React-based playgrounds.

- Added support for `console.log` in web playgrounds. When you open a playground, it will create a new `GistPad Playground` output pane and any calls to `console.log` within your playground will be written to it. By default, the console isn't automatically displayed, but you can either manually open it, or run the `GistPad: Open Playground Console` command.

  ![console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/71329302-49540380-24d8-11ea-900c-afbf84b50da9.gif)

- Added the ability to sort Gists alphabetically, in addition to the default sort behavior of updated time.

## v0.0.24 (12/21/2019)

- Added support for web playgrounds without HTML and/or CSS files. If you don't need them (e.g. because you're primarily using playgrounds for JS dev), then you can delete the files from the playground and everything will still work. Additionally, you can set the `GistPad > Playground: Include Stylesheet` or `GistPad > PlayGround: Include Markup` settings to `false` in order to suppress these files from future playgrounds.
- Fixed markdown files to open in edit mode by default as opposed to preview mode.

## v0.0.23 (12/18/2019)

- Added support for TypeScript to web playgrounds. Simply rename the `script.js` file to `script.ts` and the code will be transparently compiled for you as you code.
